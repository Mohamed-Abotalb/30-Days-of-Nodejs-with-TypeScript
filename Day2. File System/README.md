# File System

Node.js gives the functionality of File I/O by providing wrappers around the standard POSIX functions. In Node.js, File I/O methods can be performed in both synchronous as well as asynchronous form depending upon the user requirements.

In this part of node.js tutorial series we learned about file system in node.js which includes:

- Introduction to file system
- Read file operation using nodejs
  1. fs.readFile() : Read file in asynchronous way.
  2. fs.readFileSync() : Read file in synchronous way.
- Write file operation using nodejs
  1. fs.writeFile() : Write file in asynchronous way.
  2. fs.writeFileSync() : Write file in synchronous way.
- Append file operation using nodejs
  1. fs.appendFile() : Append file in asynchronous way.
  2. fs.appendFileSync() : Append file in synchronous way.
- Rename file operation using nodejs
  1. fs.rename() : Rename file name in asynchronous way.
  2. fs.renameSync() : Rename file name in synchronous way.
- Delete (unlink) file operation using nodejs
  1. fs.unlink() : Delete file in asynchronous way.
  2. fs.unlinkSync() : Delete file in synchronous way.

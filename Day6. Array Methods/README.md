# Array

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, their index starts from 0

## Array Methods

1. `push()`: used to insert an element at the end of the array.
2. `pop()`: used to remove an element from the end of the array.
3. `unshift()`: used to insert an element at the beginning of the array.
4. `shift()`: used to remove the element from the beginning of the array.
5. `reverse()`: used to reverse the order of the array such that the first element becomes the last and the last element becomes the first.
6. `sort()`: used to sort the elements of array in term of their occurrences.
7. `splice()`: it can be used in two ways i.e to either add the element into the array or remove the elements from the array.
8. `concat()`: used to join two arrays and returns a new array consisting the elements of both the arrays one after other.
9. `indexOf()`: used to return the first index of the element passed within the array or otherwise it will return -1 if the value is not found.
10. `lastIndexOf()`: used to return the last index of the element passed within the array or otherwise it will return -1 if the value is not found.
11. `join()`: used to join the elements into a string and returns the string.
12. `slice()`: used to extract a section of an array and returns a new array.
13. `every()`: used to check whether a condition in fulfilled by all the elements or not.
14. `filter()`: used to create a new array, filled with all the elements that passes a test condition usually passed as a function, from the current array.
15. `find()`: returns the first value in the array which passes a test provided as a function. If no element matches the condition, it will return `undefined`.
16. `forEach()`: it is a loop which is used to call a function for each element in the array.
17. `reduce()`: used to reduce the array to a single value. This method executes the provided function for each value of the array and stores the result in accumulator.
